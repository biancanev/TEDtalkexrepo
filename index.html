<h1>Welcome to an example webiste!!!!!</h1>
<p>This is a very long paragraph. This paragraph will be put on a website. A website
is made with HTML. HTML is the language of the web. Other web languages are CSS and 
JavaScript. These help with HTML and go hand in hand with HTML. This website also talks
about how to use HTML. HTML uses tags. Tags tell the computer what to do. This also can
be classified by the class and id function. JavaScript has a function called GetElementByID.
This finds all HTML elements that have the Element specified in the JavaScript. . .</p>
